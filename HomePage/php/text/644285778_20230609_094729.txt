If your laptop is not charging, follow these steps to troubleshoot the issue:

- Check the power adapter and charging cable for any damage. Look for frayed wires or bent connectors. If you find any issues, consider replacing them.
- Try plugging your laptop into a different power outlet to ensure the problem is not with the outlet itself.
- Reset the battery if possible. Some laptops have a battery reset function that can help resolve charging issues.13:16
