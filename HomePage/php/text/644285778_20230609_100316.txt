If your desktop computer is not displaying anything on the monitor, follow these steps:

- Check the connections between the monitor and the desktop. Ensure the cables are securely plugged in at both ends.
- Test with a different monitor or cable to rule out any issues with the current ones.
- Reset the BIOS settings to default. This can be done by accessing the BIOS menu during startup and choosing the appropriate option.
- Check the graphics card to ensure it is seated properly and functioning correctly.13:32
