If your smart TV is running slowly, start by closing unused apps running in the background. Smart TVs often have limited processing power, and having multiple apps running simultaneously can slow down the performance. Clear the cache and data of apps to free up memory and improve performance. This can be done through the TV's settings or by uninstalling and reinstalling the apps. Consider resetting the TV to factory settings if the slow performance persists. However, note that a factory reset will erase all personalized settings and installed apps.13:22
