To address overheating in your laptop, try the following:

- Clean the laptop's cooling vents using compressed air to remove dust and debris. Ensure proper airflow around the laptop.
- Use a laptop cooling pad to improve ventilation and dissipate heat more effectively.
- Avoid using the laptop on soft surfaces like beds or sofas, as they can obstruct airflow and contribute to overheating.9:57
